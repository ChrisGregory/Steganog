How my algorithm works:
	It uses the Sieve of Erathones thing to generate sequential prime numbers.
	It uses these prime numbers as indexes for pixels to read and manipulate.
	It reads/manipulates those pixels
	
Help Recieved:
	None other than help from my past self,
	who mostly had this thing done half a year ago.
	I did help a few other students, just helping them walk through
	their problems, asking them questions that don't give away the
	answer, but help them figure it out. that sort of thing.
	
Figure out how well your algorithm runs:
	So, I'm not entirely sure which algorithm we're talking about.
	I use several
		Prime number generator.
		Encoder
		Decoder
		several binary->hex->RGB converters

	All of these run better than O(width*height) because they don't get used
	on every pixel. Just the prime indexed ones.
		
Epirically analyze performance of your algorithm.
	Tests included in program to be demo'd in person.
